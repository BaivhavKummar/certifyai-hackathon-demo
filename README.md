## üéØ The Problem

Preparing for professional certifications is inefficient and expensive. Students and professionals are stuck in a cycle of costly official practice tests and generic, low-quality free quizzes that don't align with the official syllabus. This creates a significant barrier to career advancement and wastes precious study time.

## üí° Our Solution

CertifyAI solves this by providing a hyper-personalized and scalable learning ecosystem. Users can choose from a curated library of popular certifications or paste **any syllabus** to have our AI generate a relevant, high-quality mock exam instantly.

More than just a test generator, our platform provides an **actionable feedback dashboard** that pinpoints a user's weakest topics, enabling truly smart and focused studying.

## üë§ User Story: Sarah's Journey

> A driven IT professional aiming for her AWS certification was stuck, wasting time and money on generic practice tests. She discovered CertifyAI, pasted the official syllabus, and instantly received a relevant exam. The dashboard revealed her true weakness was in **"Billing and Pricing."** She studied smarter, not harder, saved money, and passed her exam with confidence.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Full Application)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   AWS Account & AWS CLI configured
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   Node.js (v18+) & npm
*   Python (v3.10+) & pip

### Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CertifyAI.git
    cd CertifyAI
    ```
2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. This file will store all your secret keys.
    ```env
    # Database URLs
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://user:password@host:port/database"

    # AWS Credentials
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
    AWS_REGION="your-aws-region"

    # AI API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

### Running with Docker

The easiest way to run the entire stack (backend, frontend, databases) is with Docker Compose.

```bash
# From the root directory
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the necessary images and start all the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## üåê Running the Streamlit Prototype

For a quick and reliable demo without setting up the full cloud stack, you can run our Streamlit prototype via Google Colab.

1.  **Upload Code:** Ensure `app.py` and `requirements.txt` from the `/prototype` folder are in a public GitHub repo.
2.  **Open Colab:** Launch a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-DnmLA7K8MBjtXV7P0gTH7jiavNLmPvG#scrollTo=pjswran3sjqs).
3.  **Run the Setup Script:** Paste and run the setup code from our previous conversations to install libraries, clone the repo, and launch the app with `ngrok`.

## üîÆ Future Scope

*   **Gamification:** Introduce leaderboards, achievements, and study streaks to increase engagement.
*   **Enterprise Tier (B2B):** A subscription model for companies to create internal training modules and track employee certification progress.
*   **AI-Generated Study Guides:** Move beyond Q&A to have the AI generate summary notes and flashcards based on a user's identified weak areas.
